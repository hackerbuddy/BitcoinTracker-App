I don't really feel like making my code public for this one yet. But here are a few working screenshots:

Amusingly, the email notifications work but I need to fix the minutes counter. 300+ minutes is 5 hours. Oops.

Also, here are some helpful links to get you started if you wanna scrape and send emails with python:

If you are an employer and you need to see my code, please contact me and I will post it. :) Thanks
